# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

### This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Keras and TensorFlow. The dataset contains information about bank customers, and the goal is to classify whether a customer will leave the bank in the future.

## Features
- **Implementation of ANN for binary classification.**
- **End-to-end pipeline including data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.**
- **Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for creating, training, and evaluating the ANN.**
